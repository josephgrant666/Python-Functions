# Git commands - Undoing Changes 

git revert <commit> Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in <commit>, then apply it to the current branch.

git reset <file> Remove <file> from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes.

git clean -n Shows which files would be removed from working directory. Use the -f flag in place of the -n flag to execute the clean.

git commit --amend Replace the last commit with the staged changes and last commit combined. Use with nothing staged to edit the last commit’s message.

git rebase <base> - Rebase the current branch onto <base>. <base> can be a commit ID, branch name, a tag, or a relative reference to HEAD.

git reflog Show a log of changes to the local repository’s HEAD. Add --relative-date flag to show date info or --all to show all refs.
