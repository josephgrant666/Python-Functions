# Git commands - Basics  

git clone <repo> - Cloning is one of the ways you can copy a repository and allows you to work on a project on your local computer.

git init - Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository.

git config user.name <name> Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user.

git add <directory> Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit. Replace <directory> with a <file> to change a specific file.

git commit -m "<message>" Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use <message> as the commit message.

git status List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked.

git log Display the entire commit history using the default format. For customization see additional options.

git diff Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory.
