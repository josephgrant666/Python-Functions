# Object relational mapper (ORM)

# A way of not having to interact anymore with the database that you are working on directly. 
# We can perform all database operations through traditional python code. No more SQL!
# Instead of manually defining tables in postgres, we can define our tables as python models.
# Queries can be made using python code - no SQL necessary.
# SQLAlchemy is the most popular ORM. This is a standalone library.
