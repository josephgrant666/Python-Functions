# Classes in Python

Classes represent an object in Python that is then given certain attributes. 

E.g.

class Person: 
    def __init__(self, age, weight, height, first_name, last_name, catch_phrase):
    self.age = age
    self.weight = weight 
    self.height = height 
    self.first_name = first_name
    self.last_name = last_name
    self.catch_phrase = catch_phrase

User = Person(27, 80, 190, "John", "Snow", "Eyyyyy")

print(user.catch_phrase) would print "Eyyyy"

Methods can then also be added to data classes:

class Person: 
    def __init__(self, age, weight, height, first_name, last_name, catch_phrase):
    self.age = age
    self.weight = weight 
    self.height = height 
    self.first_name = first_name
    self.last_name = last_name
    self.catch_phrase = catch_phrase

    def walk(self):
        print("Walking")

User = Person(27, 80, 190, "John", "Snow", "Eyyyyy")

print(user.Walk) would print "Walking"
